This project is a jpeg encoder written in pure C.
It takes a raw YUV Image(YUYV for color and 8bit Y for grayscale)

This is a modification of the [jpegant](https://code.google.com/p/jpegant/) library and the [VT-fox project](https://github.com/mitchd/vt-fox-1)

Both the above libraries are licensed under the GPLv3

The major improvements are compatibility for **images of any resolution** and support for **grayscale jpeg encoding**.
These features can be enabled or disabled before compiling the library.

This library has compiled succesfully for an x86 computer and for the STM32F4(with some minor modifications eg. removing file io) with the relevant compilers.
